\subsection{Model Calculation Flow}

Figure~\ref{fig:model_flow} shows the processing flow of the AgLU model.  
The model begins with the processing of the original data sources, 
including extraction of necessary information, aggregation of gridded datasets, 
and conversion of data formats.  
Next, the processed data are adjusted through parameter estimation via regression analysis, 
data calibration to ensure equilibrium in the base year, 
and coefficient calibration for model consistency.  

Using these prepared data, the model then performs future scenario calculations.  
For each year, equilibrium solutions are iteratively computed based on 
the base-year data, the results of the previous year, and the scenario assumptions.  
The aggregated annual results provide the final outputs for each scenario.  
Additionally, model results are converted into the submission templates 
of AgMIP (Agricultural Model Intercomparison and Improvement Project) 
and IAMC (Integrated Assessment Modeling Consortium) 
to facilitate data exchange and comparison.

\subsection{Programs within the Model}

This section provides an overview of the major programs used in the AgLU model.  
Each component plays a specific role in data processing, parameter calibration, and scenario simulation.

\subsection{Execution Method}

The AgLU model can be executed by running the shell script 
\texttt{AgLU/shell/execution.sh} on either Cygwin or Ubuntu environments.  
Model configurations are defined in \texttt{AgLU/shell/model\_setting.sh}.  
As summarized in Table~\ref{tab:model_setting}, the configurable items include 
the selection of executable programs, scenario settings, and computational environment settings.
